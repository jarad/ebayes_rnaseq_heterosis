	focused on noise sources or noise propagation through gene networks

	we showed that noise frequency content is determined by the underlying
	gene circuits, leading to a mapping between gene circuit structure
	and the noise frequency range. An intriguing prediction from our
	previous studies was that negative autoregulation shifts noise to
	higher frequencies where it is more easily filtered out by gene networks--a
	property that may contribute to the prevalence of autoregulation
	motifs (for example, found in the regulation of approximately 40%
	of Escherichia coli genes). Here we measure noise frequency content
	in growing cultures of E. coli, and verify the link between gene
	circuit structure and noise spectra by demonstrating the negative
	autoregulation-mediated spectral shift. We further demonstrate that
	noise spectral measurements provide mechanistic insights into gene
	regulation, as perturbations of gene circuit parameters are discernible
	in the measured noise frequency ranges. These results suggest that
	noise spectral measurements could facilitate the discovery of novel
	regulatory relationships.},

	automated image analysis. Using ubiquitously expressed histone–GFP
	fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a confocal microscope, the
	imaging protocol captures embryogenesis at high spatial (31 planes
	at 1 $\mu$m apart) and temporal (every minute) resolution without
	apparent effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms
	then automatically recognizes cells at each time point, tracks cell
	movements, divisions and deaths over time and assigns cell identities
	based on the canonical naming scheme. Starting from the four-cell
	stage (or earlier), our software, named , can trace the lineage up
	to the 350-cell stage in 25 min on a desktop computer. The few errors
	of automated lineaging can then be corrected in a few hours with
	a graphic interface that allows easy navigation of the images and
	the reported lineage tree. The system can be used to characterize
	lineage phenotypes of genes and/or extended to determine gene expression
	patterns in a living embryo at the single-cell level. We envision
	that this automation will make it practical to systematically decipher
	the developmental genes and pathways encoded in the genome of .},

	The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework,

	to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared.
	Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC is increasingly

  abstract = {Much of the information available about factors that affect mRNA decay
	in Escherichia coli, and by inference in other bacteria, has been
	gleaned from study of less than 25 of the [approx]4,300 predicted
	E. coli messages. To investigate these factors more broadly, we examined
	the half-lives and steady-state abundance of known and predicted
	E. coli mRNAs at single-gene resolution by using two-color fluorescent
	DNA microarrays. An rRNA-based strategy for normalization of microarray
	data was developed to permit quantitation of mRNA decay after transcriptional
	arrest by rifampicin. We found that globally, mRNA half-lives were
	similar in nutrient-rich media and defined media in which the generation
	time was approximately tripled. A wide range of stabilities was observed
	for individual mRNAs of E. coli, although [approx]80% of all mRNAs
	had half-lives between 3 and 8 min. Genes having biologically related
	metabolic functions were commonly observed to have similar stabilities.
	Whereas the half-lives of a limited number of mRNAs correlated positively

	is not predictive of increased abundance. Neither the density of
	putative sites of cleavage by RNase E, which is believed to initiate
	mRNA decay in E. coli, nor the free energy of folding of 5' or 3'
	untranslated region sequences was predictive of mRNA half-life. Our

  abstract = {Recent advances in measuring gene expression at the single-cell level
	have highlighted the stochastic nature of messenger RNA and protein
	synthesis. Stochastic gene expression creates a source of variability
	in the abundance of cellular components, even among isogenic cells
	exposed to an identical environment. Recent integrated experimental
	and modelling studies have shed light on the molecular sources of
	this variability. However, many of these studies focus on systems
	that have reached a steady state and therefore do not address a large
	class of dynamic phenomena including oscillatory gene expression.
	Here we develop a general protocol for analysing and predicting stochastic
	gene expression in systems that never reach steady states. We use
	this framework to analyse experimentally stochastic expression of
	genes driven by the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock. We find
	that, although the average expression at two points in the circadian
	cycle separated by 12 hours is identical, the variability at these
	two time points can be different. We show that this is a general
	feature of out-of-steady-state systems. We demonstrate how intrinsic
	noise sources, owing to random births and deaths of mRNAs and proteins,
	or extrinsic noise sources, which introduce fluctuations in rate
	constants, affect the cell-to-cell variability. To distinguish experimentally
	between these sources, we measured how the correlation between expression
	fluctuations of two identical genes is modulated during the circadian
	cycle. This quantitative framework is generally applicable to any
	out-of-steady-state system and will be necessary for understanding
	the fidelity of dynamic cellular systems.},

  abstract = {Here we studied the quantitative behaviour and cell-to-cell variability
	of a prototypical eukaryotic cell-fate decision system, the mating
	pheromone response pathway in yeast. We dissected and measured sources
	of variation in system output, analysing thousands of individual,
	genetically identical cells. Only a small proportion of total cell-to-cell
	variation is caused by random fluctuations in gene transcription
	and translation during the response ('expression noise'). Instead,
	variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual
	cells to transmit signals through the pathway ('pathway capacity')
	and to express proteins from genes ('expression capacity'). Cells
	with high expression capacity express proteins at a higher rate and
	increase in volume more rapidly. Our results identify two mechanisms
	that regulate cell-to-cell variation in pathway capacity. First,
	the MAP kinase Fus3 suppresses variation at high pheromone levels,
	while the MAP kinase Kss1 enhances variation at low pheromone levels.
	Second, pathway capacity and expression capacity are negatively correlated,
	suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows cells to respond
	more precisely to pheromone in the presence of a large variation
	in expression capacity.},

	cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from
	generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour,

	The examination is made for a standard situation in order to focus
	on the inferential principles. A uniform presentation of methods,
	by expressions of likelihood ratios, facilitates the comparisons
	between methods. The correspondences between criteria of optimality
	and methods are examined. The situations and parameter values for
	which some commonly used methods have optimality properties are thus
	determined. A linear approximation of the full likelihood ratio method,
	which satisfies several criteria of optimality, is presented. This
	linear approximation is used to examine when linear methods are approximately
	optimal. Methods for complicated situations are reviewed with respect
	to optimality and robustness. /// Des diff?rents crit?res d'optimalit?

	framework involves the introduction of m- 1 latent data points between

	the posterior distribution of the latent process and the model parameters.
	The methodology is applied to the estimation of parameters in a prokaryotic
	autoregulatory gene network. },

	repressed and activated. We develop a stochastic model that quantitatively
	captures the means and distributions of the expression from the engineered
	promoter of this modular system, and show that the model can be extended
	and used to accurately predict the in vivo behaviour of the network
	when it is expanded to include positive feedback. The model also
	reveals the counterintuitive prediction that noise in protein expression
	levels can increase upon arrest of cell growth and division, which
	we confirm experimentally. This work shows that the properties of
	regulatory subsystems can be used to predict the behaviour of larger,
	more complex regulatory networks, and that this bottom-up approach

	structures. Two discretization strategies are mainly focused, that
	are one-step Taylor/Lie series based method and multi-step Runge-Kutta
	method. A new discretization approach based on Taylor expansion and

	an alternative procedure that involves imputing the missing data
	sequentially and computing appropriate importance sampling weights.
	In many applications this new procedure works very well without the
	need for iterations. Sensitivity analysis, influence analysis, and
	updating with new data can be performed cheaply. Bayesian prediction
	and model selection can also be incorporated. Examples taken from
	a wide range of applications are used for illustration.},

  abstract = {Circadian oscillators, which provide internal daily periodicity, are
	found in a variety of living organisms, including mammals, insects,
	plants, fungi and cyanobacteria. Remarkably, these biochemical oscillators
	are resilient to external and internal modifications, such as temperature
	and cell division cycles. They have to be 'fluctuation (noise) resistant'
	because relative fluctuations in the number of messenger RNA and
	protein molecules forming the intracellular oscillators are likely
	to be large. In multicellular organisms, the strong temporal stability
	of circadian clocks, despite molecular fluctuations, can easily be
	explained by intercellular interactions. Here we study circadian
	rhythms and their stability in unicellular cyanobacteria Synechoccocus
	elongatus. Low-light-level microscopy has allowed us to measure gene
	expression under circadian control in single bacteria, showing that
	the circadian clock is indeed a property of individual cells. Our
	measurements show that the oscillators have a strong temporal stability
	with a correlation time of several months. In contrast to many circadian
	clocks in multicellular organisms, this stability seems to be ensured
	by the intracellular biochemical network, because the interactions
	between oscillators seem to be negligible.},

	a nonlinear programming (NLP)problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic
	constraints. These problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned
	and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based)local optimization
	methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this
	limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and
	stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study
	considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical
	dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic
	algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem
	successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee
	global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact
	that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost
	function, make them the best available candidates.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, successful research on metabolic systems relies on teams
	of specialists. Because of the enormous complexity of these systems,
	many experimental groups have sought collaborations with theoreticians
	for data analysis and modeling. Predictably, cultural differences
	in scientific approach, methodology, assumptions, and language have
	led to some persistent difficulties in communication across the experiment-theory
	frontier. This report attempts to diagnose some of these difficulties
	from the perspective of 30 years' experience in both experimental
	and theoretical biology, and to suggest guidelines for effective
	collaboration between experimentalists and theorists. As these collaborations
	move to the level of cellular and molecular biology, effective communication
	will become all the more important because the simple linear rate
	laws of radiotracer and stable-isotope kinetics will no longer suffice.
	This is because every form of regulation and control, hallmarks of
	metabolic systems, results in nonlinear kinetics. To advance this
	transition to nonlinear cellular and molecular metabolic models and
	to facilitate communication between experimental and theoretical
	collaborators, a general procedure for incorporating control mechanisms
	in metabolic rate laws is developed based on the familiar rapid-equilibrium
	assumption of classical enzyme kinetics.},

	We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation

	To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis-

	These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can

  year = {2003},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {2},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Emergency department (ED) based syndromic surveillance
	systems identify abnormally high visit rates that may be an early
	signal of a bioterrorist attack. For example, an anthrax outbreak
	might first be detectable as an unusual increase in the number of
	patients reporting to the ED with respiratory symptoms. Reliably
	identifying these abnormal visit patterns requires a good understanding
	of the normal patterns of healthcare usage. Unfortunately, systematic
	methods for determining the expected number of (ED) visits on a particular
	day have not yet been well established. We present here a generalized
	methodology for developing models of expected ED visit rates.METHODS:Using
	time-series methods, we developed robust models of ED utilization
	for the purpose of defining expected visit rates. The models were
	based on nearly a decade of historical data at a major metropolitan
	academic, tertiary care pediatric emergency department. The historical
	data were fit using trimmed-mean seasonal models, and additional
	models were fit with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
	residuals to account for recent trends in the data. The detection
	capabilities of the model were tested with simulated outbreaks.RESULTS:Models
	were built both for overall visits and for respiratory-related visits,
	classified according to the chief complaint recorded at the beginning
	of each visit. The mean absolute percentage error of the ARIMA models
	was 9.37% for overall visits and 27.54% for respiratory visits. A
	simple detection system based on the ARIMA model of overall visits
	was able to detect 7-day-long simulated outbreaks of 30 visits per
	day with 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Sensitivity decreased
	with outbreak size, dropping to 94% for outbreaks of 20 visits per
	day, and 57% for 10 visits per day, all while maintaining a 97% benchmark
	specificity.CONCLUSIONS:Time series methods applied to historical
	ED utilization data are an important tool for syndromic surveillance.
	Accurate forecasting of emergency department total utilization as
	well as the rates of particular syndromes is possible. The multiple
	models in the system account for both long-term and recent trends,
	and an integrated alarms strategy combining these two perspectives
	may provide a more complete picture to public health authorities.
	The systematic methodology described here can be generalized to other
	healthcare settings to develop automated surveillance systems capable
	of detecting anomalies in disease patterns and healthcare utilization.},

	Such partition asymmetries are set by the actual numbers of proteins
	present, and thus provide a means to quantify fluorescence levels.
	We present a Bayesian algorithm that infers from such data both the

	error. Our algorithm works for arbitrarily sized data sets and handles
	consistently any missing measurements. We verify the algorithm with
	extensive simulation and demonstrate its application to experimental

	from overexpressing Escherichia coli cells, possesses a DNase and
	an RNase activity. Mutations in the active center of T7 RNA polymerase
	abolished or greatly decreased the nuclease activity. This nuclease
	activity is specific for single-stranded DNA and RNA oligonucleotides
	and does not manifest on double-stranded DNAs. Under the conditions
	of promoter-driven transcription on double-stranded DNA, no nuclease
	activity was observed. The nuclease attacks DNA oligonucleotides
	in mono- or dinucleotide steps. The nuclease is a 3['] to 5['] exonuclease
	leaving a 3[']-OH end, and it degrades DNA oligonucleotides to a
	minimum size of 3 to 5 nucleotides. It is completely dependent on
	Mg2+. The T7 RNA polymerase-nuclease is inhibited by T7 lysozyme
	and heparin, although not completely. In the presence of rNTPs, the
	nuclease activity is suppressed but an unusual 3[']-end-initiated
	polymerase activity is unmasked. RNA from isolated pre-elongation
	and elongation complexes arrested by a psoralen roadblock or naturally
	paused at the 3[']-end of an oligonucleotide template exhibited evidence
	of nuclease activity. The nuclease activity of T7 RNA polymerase
	is unrelated to pyrophosphorolysis. We propose that the nuclease
	of T7 RNA polymerase acts only in arrested or paused elongation complexes,
	and that in combination with the unusual 3[']-end polymerizing activity,
	causes heterogeneity in elongation complexes. Additionally, during
	normal transcription elongation, the kinetic balance between nuclease
	and polymerase is shifted in favor of polymerase.},

  abstract = {P strains of Drosophila are distinguished from M strains by having
	P elements in their genomes and also by having the P cytotype, a
	maternally inherited condition that strongly represses P-element-induced
	hybrid dysgenesis. The P cytotype is associated with P elements inserted
	near the left telomere of the X chromosome. Repression by the telomeric
	P elements TP5 and TP6 is significantly enhanced when these elements
	are crossed into M' strains, which, like P strains, carry P elements,
	but have little or no ability to repress dysgenesis. The telomeric
	and M' P elements must coexist in females for this enhanced repression
	ability to develop. However, once established, it is transmitted
	maternally to the immediate offspring independently of the telomeric
	P elements themselves. Females that carry a telomeric P element but
	that do not carry M' P elements may also transmit an ability to repress
	dysgenesis to their offspring independently of the telomeric P element.
	Cytotype regulation therefore involves a maternally transmissible
	product of telomeric P elements that can interact synergistically
	with products from paternally inherited M' P elements. This synergism
	between TP and M' P elements also appears to persist for at least
	one generation after the TP has been removed from the genotype.},

	In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state

	with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual
	genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent
	state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes
	interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous
	entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show
	that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in
	the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse
	microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit
	components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting
	data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable
	core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain
	both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested
	this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering
	the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven
	by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby
	providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.},

  abstract = {Molecular noise in gene expression can generate substantial variability
	in protein concentration. However, its effect on the precision of
	a natural eukaryotic circuit such as the control of cell cycle remains
	unclear. We use single-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled budding
	yeast to measure times from division to budding (G1) and from budding
	to the next division. The variability in G1 decreases with the square
	root of the ploidy through a 1N/2N/4N ploidy series, consistent with
	simple stochastic models for molecular noise. Also, increasing the
	gene dosage of G1 cyclins decreases the variability in G1. A new
	single-cell reporter for cell protein content allows us to determine
	the contribution to temporal G1 variability of deterministic size
	control (that is, smaller cells extending G1). Cell size control
	contributes significantly to G1 variability in daughter cells but
	not in mother cells. However, even in daughters, size-independent
	noise is the largest quantitative contributor to G1 variability.
	Exit of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 from the nucleus partitions
	G1 into two temporally uncorrelated and functionally distinct steps.
	The first step, which depends on the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, corresponds
	to noisy size control that extends G1 in small daughters, but is
	of negligible duration in mothers. The second step, whose variability
	decreases with increasing CLN2 gene dosage, is similar in mothers
	and daughters. This analysis decomposes the regulatory dynamics of
	the Start transition into two independent modules, a size sensing
	module and a timing module, each of which is predominantly controlled
	by a different G1 cyclin.},

	products. Further, it integrates the capability of conducting both
	deterministic and stochastic simulations. Availability and supplementary

  abstract = {De novo engineering of gene circuits inside cells is extremely difficult,
	and efforts to realize predictable and robust performance must deal
	with noise in gene expression and variation in phenotypes between
	cells. Here we demonstrate that by coupling gene expression to cell
	survival and death using cell-cell communication, we can programme
	the dynamics of a population despite variability in the behaviour
	of individual cells. Specifically, we have built and characterized
	a 'population control' circuit that autonomously regulates the density
	of an Escherichia coli population. The cell density is broadcasted
	and detected by elements from a bacterial quorum-sensing system,
	which in turn regulate the death rate. As predicted by a simple mathematical
	model, the circuit can set a stable steady state in terms of cell
	density and gene expression that is easily tunable by varying the
	stability of the cell-cell communication signal. This circuit incorporates
	a mechanism for programmed death in response to changes in the environment,
	and allows us to probe the design principles of its more complex
	natural counterparts.},
